PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In today's competitive business environment, effective talent management is crucial for organizational success. Understanding hiring trends and employee distribution across departments can provide valuable insights that guide HR strategies, workforce planning, and resource allocation. 

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI that visualizes the hiring trends over the years, departmental performance, and overall employee statistics. This dashboard will utilize data from the hr_analytics database, specifically focusing on two CSV datasets that contain detailed records of employees hired over time.

Key Metrics and Visualizations:
1. Overall Employee Summary Dashboard:
   - Key Metrics Cards:
     - Total Employees: A metric card displaying the total count of employees.
     - Average Salary: A metric card reflecting the average salary across the organization.
     - Total Departments: A metric card showing the total number of unique departments.
   - Visualizations:
     - Pie Chart: Distribution of employees by department, allowing quick insights into departmental sizes.
     - Bar Chart: Average salary per department, highlighting pay disparities across the organization.

2.Hires Per Year Analysis:
  - Table: A chart visualizing the number of employees hired each year, segmented by department. This will allow for comparison of hiring practices across different departments over time, helping identify which departments are expanding or contracting.
   - Data Labels: Each bar will include data labels to provide precise counts of hires, enhancing interpretability.

Expected Outcomes:
The HR Analytics Dashboard aims to:
- Provide a comprehensive view of hiring trends, enabling HR to make informed decisions regarding workforce planning.
- Identify departments that require additional recruitment efforts or budget adjustments based on hiring patterns.
- Facilitate discussions among HR and management teams about talent acquisition strategies and resource allocation.

By utilizing this dashboard, stakeholders will have a powerful tool to analyse employee data, uncover insights, and drive strategic HR initiatives.
